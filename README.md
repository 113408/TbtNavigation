# TbtNavigation
Integrate Mapbox Navigation feature as a native module for React Native

To see this project in action, just clone it or download it. Open the project folder and run `npm install --save`.
After installing the react native necessary module, `cd ios/` folder and run `pod install` that will download and setup the Pods for you.
Last step: create an account on Mapbox and put your `access_token` key into the plist of the ios project.
You can then run the project either from Xcode or from your terminal using react-native cli.
